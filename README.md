# Study of influence of day-to-day activities on Obesity Levels

### Introduction

Obesity poses serious health risks and expenses, making it a growing public health concern. Obesity predisposes people to a variety of non-communicable diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver disease, arthritis, and at least 13 types of cancer. Using a <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition"> dataset </a> of 2,111 patients, this study conducts extensive statistical modeling to identify the set of patient characteristics most intricately linked to an increased risk of obesity. The variables include things like age and gender, dietary preferences, exercise routines, and family medical histories. Key risk relationships can be clarified by testing for significant correlations and interactions between these features and patient obesity levels classified as normal, overweight, or obese.

### Aim

To extract valuable insights, visual data exploration will be used followed by hypothesis testing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The study seeks to gather important information for customized intervention strategies, high-risk screening protocols, and public policy changes targeted at obesity prevention. The results of this study may have a major impact on the creation of targeted treatments, which could lower a serious risk to public health and social progress.

### Data Description

The data was gathered using an online survey, where anonymous users responded to some questions designed for the study. 17 attributes and 2111 records were obtained after processing the collected data. After studying the obtained data, we renamed a few attributes which had a significant relation with the predictive variable `NObeyesdad`. 

All the 17 attributes can be classified into 3 groups with correlated/similar attributes grouped together.
- The first group is of features related to eating habits of the participants in the survey: the frequency of high-calorie food consumption (FAVC), the frequency of vegetable intake (FCVC), the number of main meals (NCP), the consumption of food between meals (CAEC), the daily consumption of water (CH20), and the consumption of alcohol (CALC).
- The second group is linked to physical condition: frequency of physical activity (FAF), time spent using technological devices (TUE), transportation used (MTRANS), and calories consumed monitoring (SCC). Additional variables that were acquired included gender, age, height, and weight.
- Lastly, the data had been labeled, data from the WHO, and Mexican Normativity were used to produce the class variable NObesity, which was then assigned the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III.
